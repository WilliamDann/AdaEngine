# Ada Engine

This is a chess engine written from scratch in the Go programming language. This means I am writing a chess library to go along with the engine itself.

This is still very much a work in progress! A lot of the code is going to change a lot while I get things going.

Eventually the goal is to allow the engine to give more information than a static number when eval-ing a position.
